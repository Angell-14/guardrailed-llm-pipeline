The results demonstrate how safety-first design can be implemented without relying solely on hard refusals, making the pipeline suitable for real-world, high stakes GenAI applications.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations\n\nThis implementation relies on dataset labels and simple keyword-based heuristics rather than learned models. As a result, some posts may still be treated conservatively due to contextual ambiguity or inherited labels from conversational threads. Additionally, the response strategies are template-based and do not incorporate live LLM\ngeneration or external safety policies.\n\n---\n\n## Future Improvements\n\nFuture iterations of this pipeline could include:\n- LLM-based or trained intent classifiers for improved accuracy\n- Policy engines for fine-grained safety rules\n- Human-in-the-loop escalation for borderline cases\n- Logging and monitoring for auditability and continuous improvement\n- Integration with RAG systems for safe, grounded responses\n\nThese extensions would further improve reliability and scalability in production environments.\n","metadata":{}}]}
